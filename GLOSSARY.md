# Glossary of Terms

A comprehensive reference of terms, acronyms, and protocols commonly encountered in red team operations, adversary emulation, and offensive security engagements.

---

## A

**ACE** -- Access Control Entry. A single entry in an Access Control List (ACL) that defines permissions for a specific security principal on an object, such as a file, registry key, or Active Directory object.

**ACL** -- Access Control List. A list of Access Control Entries that defines who has what permissions on a given object. Misconfigured ACLs are a common attack vector in Active Directory environments.

**ADCS** -- Active Directory Certificate Services. Microsoft's PKI implementation integrated with Active Directory, used to issue and manage digital certificates. ADCS misconfigurations (such as vulnerable certificate templates) can be exploited for privilege escalation and persistence.

**AMSI** -- Antimalware Scan Interface. A Windows interface that allows applications and services to integrate with antimalware products. AMSI inspects scripts (PowerShell, VBScript, JScript) and .NET assemblies at runtime, making it a key defensive control that red teams must bypass during engagements.

**APT** -- Advanced Persistent Threat. A sophisticated threat actor, typically nation-state or state-sponsored, that conducts prolonged and targeted cyberattacks. Red team operations often emulate specific APT tradecraft to test organizational defenses.

**AS-REP** -- Authentication Service Reply. A Kerberos message returned by the KDC when a user requests a TGT. If Kerberos pre-authentication is disabled for an account, an attacker can request an AS-REP and attempt to crack the encrypted portion offline (AS-REP Roasting).

**ASR** -- Attack Surface Reduction. A set of rules in Microsoft Defender that block or audit potentially malicious behaviors such as Office macro execution, credential theft from LSASS, and script-based attacks.

**AV** -- Antivirus. Software designed to detect and remove malware. Modern AV solutions use signature-based, heuristic, and behavioral detection methods that red teams must account for during payload development.

---

## B

**BCD** -- Boot Configuration Data. A firmware-independent database for boot-time configuration data used by Windows Boot Manager. Manipulation of BCD can be used for persistence or to inhibit system recovery.

**BloodHound** -- BloodHound. An Active Directory reconnaissance and attack path analysis tool that uses graph theory to reveal hidden and unintended relationships within an AD environment. It collects data via SharpHound or AzureHound and maps paths to high-value targets like Domain Admins.

**BOF** -- Beacon Object File. A small compiled C program designed to run within the memory space of a Cobalt Strike Beacon (or compatible C2 agent) without spawning a new process. BOFs are favored for OPSEC because they avoid the telemetry generated by process creation.

**BYOVD** -- Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver. An attack technique where an adversary loads a legitimately signed but vulnerable kernel driver onto a target system, then exploits it to gain kernel-level access. BYOVD is commonly used to disable or blind EDR products.

---

## C

**C2** -- Command and Control. The infrastructure and communication channels used by an attacker to maintain communication with compromised systems. C2 frameworks include Cobalt Strike, Sliver, Mythic, Brute Ratel, and Havoc, among others.

**CALM** -- Constrained Application Launching Mode. A restrictive application execution policy that limits which applications can run on a system, typically enforced via AppLocker or WDAC.

**CLM** -- Constrained Language Mode. A PowerShell language mode that restricts the available language elements, preventing access to .NET types, COM objects, and other sensitive APIs. CLM is enforced by AppLocker or WDAC and is a common obstacle during engagements.

**COM** -- Component Object Model. A Microsoft binary-interface standard for software components. COM objects can be abused for execution, persistence (via COM hijacking), and lateral movement through DCOM.

**CSRSS** -- Client/Server Runtime Subsystem. A critical Windows system process responsible for console windows and thread creation/deletion. It runs with SYSTEM privileges and is a high-value target for process injection and privilege escalation.

---

## D

**DA** -- Domain Admin. A member of the Domain Admins group in Active Directory, possessing full administrative control over all objects in the domain. Achieving DA is a common objective in red team engagements.

**DACL** -- Discretionary Access Control List. The component of an ACL that identifies who is allowed or denied access to an object. DACL misconfigurations are frequently exploited for privilege escalation in Active Directory.

**DCOM** -- Distributed Component Object Model. An extension of COM that allows COM objects to communicate across a network. DCOM can be leveraged for lateral movement by invoking methods on remote objects without needing traditional remote execution services.

**DCSync** -- DCSync. An attack technique that simulates the behavior of a Domain Controller to request password data via the Directory Replication Service (DRS) remote protocol. It requires Replicating Directory Changes privileges and can extract NTLM hashes, Kerberos keys, and password history.

**DCShadow** -- DCShadow. An advanced persistence technique that temporarily registers a rogue Domain Controller in Active Directory to inject arbitrary changes into the AD database via replication. It leaves minimal forensic traces compared to other AD modification methods.

**DLL** -- Dynamic Link Library. A shared library file in Windows that contains code and data usable by multiple programs. DLL hijacking, side-loading, and injection are common attack techniques.

**DPAPI** -- Data Protection Application Programming Interface. A Windows cryptographic API that provides data protection services to applications. DPAPI protects browser passwords, Wi-Fi keys, and other secrets; extracting the DPAPI master keys enables decryption of this protected data.

---

## E

**EA** -- Enterprise Admin. A member of the Enterprise Admins group in Active Directory, possessing full administrative control across all domains in a forest. Compromising an EA account grants the highest level of domain privilege.

**EDR** -- Endpoint Detection and Response. A security solution that monitors endpoints for suspicious activity, collects telemetry, and provides response capabilities. EDR products (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Carbon Black) are the primary defensive obstacle for red teams.

**ETW** -- Event Tracing for Windows. A high-performance kernel-level tracing facility in Windows used by security tools to monitor process creation, network activity, and other events. Patching or disabling ETW providers is a common evasion technique, though it carries high OPSEC risk.

---

## F

**FQDN** -- Fully Qualified Domain Name. The complete domain name for a specific host, including all levels of the domain hierarchy (e.g., server01.corp.example.com). Proper use of FQDNs versus NetBIOS names can affect authentication behavior and detection.

**GUID** -- Globally Unique Identifier. A 128-bit identifier used extensively in Windows and Active Directory to uniquely identify objects, COM classes, and interfaces.

---

## H

**HTA** -- HTML Application. A Microsoft Windows program whose source code consists of HTML and scripting languages. HTAs run with full trust outside the browser sandbox and are commonly used as initial access payloads because they can execute arbitrary code.

**HTTP/S** -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (Secure). The foundational protocol for web communication. HTTPS C2 channels blend into normal web traffic, making them the most common transport for command and control.

---

## I

**IFEO** -- Image File Execution Options. A Windows registry mechanism originally intended for debugging, located at `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options`. IFEO can be abused for persistence by setting a debugger key that redirects execution of a target binary to a malicious payload.

**IOC** -- Indicator of Compromise. An artifact observed on a network or system that indicates a potential intrusion, such as a malicious IP address, file hash, or registry modification. Red teams must minimize IOCs to avoid detection.

---

## J

**JEA** -- Just Enough Administration. A PowerShell security technology that enables delegated administration by restricting administrative access to a predefined set of commands and parameters. JEA can limit the impact of compromised administrative credentials, but misconfigured JEA endpoints may provide escalation paths.

---

## K

**KDC** -- Key Distribution Center. The Kerberos authentication server component (running on Domain Controllers) responsible for issuing TGTs and TGSs. Compromising the KDC or its keys (KRBTGT) grants total domain control.

**Kerberoasting** -- Kerberoasting. An attack technique that requests Kerberos TGS tickets for service accounts with registered SPNs, then attempts to crack the ticket offline to recover the service account password. It requires only a valid domain user account and generates minimal suspicious activity.

**KRBTGT** -- Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket Account. The Active Directory service account whose keys are used to encrypt and sign all TGTs in a domain. Compromising the KRBTGT hash enables the creation of Golden Tickets, granting unrestricted access to the entire domain.

---

## L

**LAPS** -- Local Administrator Password Solution. A Microsoft solution that manages unique, randomized local administrator passwords on domain-joined computers, storing them as confidential attributes in Active Directory. If LAPS attribute permissions are misconfigured, the passwords can be read by unauthorized users.

**LDAP** -- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. The protocol used to query and modify Active Directory objects. LDAP queries are fundamental to AD enumeration and can be performed with tools like ldapsearch, PowerView, or SharpLDAP.

**LLMNR** -- Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution. A Microsoft protocol that resolves hostnames on a local network when DNS resolution fails. LLMNR is vulnerable to poisoning attacks where an attacker responds to broadcast name queries to capture NTLMv2 hashes.

**LOLBAS** -- Living Off the Land Binaries, Scripts, and Libraries. Legitimate Microsoft-signed binaries and scripts that can be repurposed for malicious activities including execution, download, persistence, and reconnaissance. Using LOLBAS techniques avoids introducing foreign binaries to the target environment.

**LSASS** -- Local Security Authority Subsystem Service. The Windows process responsible for enforcing security policy, handling user authentication, and storing credentials in memory. Dumping LSASS memory is one of the most common credential theft techniques and is heavily monitored by EDR products.

---

## M

**MFA** -- Multi-Factor Authentication. An authentication method requiring two or more verification factors. MFA significantly raises the bar for credential-based attacks, though bypass techniques exist (MFA fatigue, token theft, adversary-in-the-middle proxies).

**MITRE ATT&CK** -- MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge. A globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. ATT&CK provides a common language for describing adversary behavior and is used to structure red team operations and evaluate defensive coverage.

**MSBuild** -- Microsoft Build Engine. A platform for building applications that can be abused to execute arbitrary C# code from XML project files. MSBuild is a signed Microsoft binary (LOLBAS) and can bypass application whitelisting.

---

## N

**NBNS** -- NetBIOS Name Service. A legacy name resolution protocol that broadcasts queries on the local network segment. Like LLMNR, NBNS is vulnerable to poisoning attacks for credential interception.

**NTLM** -- NT LAN Manager. A suite of Microsoft security protocols for authentication. NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 hashes can be captured through poisoning attacks, relayed to other services (NTLM relay), or cracked offline. NTLM relay attacks remain one of the most impactful techniques in Active Directory environments.

---

## O

**OPSEC** -- Operational Security. The practice of identifying and protecting critical information about operations, techniques, and capabilities. In red teaming, OPSEC refers to minimizing the forensic footprint and detection risk of offensive actions.

**OU** -- Organizational Unit. A container within Active Directory used to organize objects such as users, groups, and computers. GPO linkage and delegation of control are managed at the OU level.

---

## P

**PAW** -- Privileged Access Workstation. A hardened workstation dedicated to performing sensitive administrative tasks, designed to reduce the attack surface for credential theft and lateral movement. PAWs are part of a tiered administration model.

**PPL** -- Protected Process Light. A Windows security mechanism that restricts access to protected processes, including LSASS when RunAsPPL is configured. PPL prevents standard credential dumping tools from accessing LSASS memory without a kernel-level bypass.

**PRT** -- Primary Refresh Token. A key artifact used in Azure AD / Entra ID authentication that provides SSO capabilities across cloud and on-premises applications. Stealing a PRT grants access to all resources the user is authorized for without additional authentication prompts.

**PtH** -- Pass the Hash. An attack technique where an attacker uses a captured NTLM hash to authenticate to a remote system without knowing the plaintext password. PtH works because NTLM authentication uses the hash directly, not the password.

**PtT** -- Pass the Ticket. An attack technique where a stolen Kerberos ticket (TGT or TGS) is injected into a session to authenticate as the ticket owner without possessing their credentials.

---

## R

**RBCD** -- Resource-Based Constrained Delegation. A Kerberos delegation model where the target resource specifies which accounts are allowed to delegate to it via the `msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity` attribute. RBCD can be abused for privilege escalation when an attacker controls an account with write access to a computer object.

**RDP** -- Remote Desktop Protocol. A Microsoft protocol for remote graphical access to Windows systems. RDP is commonly used for lateral movement and remote administration during engagements.

**ROE** -- Rules of Engagement. A formal document agreed upon between the red team and the client that defines the scope, objectives, constraints, and boundaries of an engagement. The ROE establishes what is and is not permitted during the operation.

**RPC** -- Remote Procedure Call. A protocol that allows a program to request a service from a program on another computer in a network. Many Windows administrative tools and attack techniques (DCSync, remote service management) operate over RPC.

---

## S

**S4U** -- Service for User. A set of Kerberos protocol extensions (S4U2Self and S4U2Proxy) that allow a service to obtain tickets on behalf of a user. S4U extensions are central to constrained delegation attacks and can be abused to impersonate arbitrary users to specific services.

**SACL** -- System Access Control List. The component of an ACL that specifies which access attempts generate audit records. SACLs determine what gets logged in the Security event log.

**SAM** -- Security Account Manager. A database in Windows that stores local user account credentials. The SAM database can be extracted for offline password cracking using tools like secretsdump or reg save.

**SID** -- Security Identifier. A unique identifier assigned to each security principal (user, group, computer) in Windows and Active Directory. SIDs are used internally for access control decisions and are critical to understanding privilege relationships.

**SIEM** -- Security Information and Event Management. A platform that aggregates and analyzes security event data from across an organization's infrastructure. SIEMs (Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, QRadar, Elastic) are the primary detection and correlation engine that red teams must contend with.

**SMB** -- Server Message Block. A network file sharing protocol used extensively in Windows environments. SMB is used for lateral movement, file transfer, and numerous attack techniques including relay attacks and remote code execution.

**SOC** -- Security Operations Center. The organizational function responsible for monitoring, detecting, and responding to security incidents. The SOC team operates the SIEM, EDR, and other defensive tools that red teams are testing.

**SPN** -- Service Principal Name. A unique identifier for a service instance in Active Directory, used by Kerberos authentication. SPNs are required for Kerberoasting and are used to identify service accounts.

**SSDL** -- Security Descriptor Definition Language. A string format for describing Windows security descriptors, used in tools and scripts to define or analyze ACLs on objects.

---

## T

**TGT** -- Ticket Granting Ticket. A Kerberos ticket issued by the KDC that proves a user has successfully authenticated. The TGT is used to request TGS tickets for accessing specific services. Stealing or forging a TGT (Golden Ticket) provides broad domain access.

**TGS** -- Ticket Granting Service. A Kerberos ticket issued for accessing a specific service, requested using a valid TGT. Forging a TGS (Silver Ticket) provides access to a specific service without interacting with the KDC.

**TTP** -- Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures. The behavior patterns and methods used by threat actors, described in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Red teams emulate adversary TTPs to provide realistic threat simulation.

---

## U

**UAC** -- User Account Control. A Windows security feature that prompts for consent or credentials when an action requires elevated privileges. UAC bypass techniques allow execution at high integrity without triggering the consent prompt.

**UNC** -- Universal Naming Convention. A standard for identifying shared resources on a network (e.g., `\\server\share`). UNC paths are used in numerous attack techniques including forced authentication and credential capture.

---

## V

**VDI** -- Virtual Desktop Infrastructure. A technology that hosts desktop environments on a centralized server. VDI environments present unique challenges and opportunities for red teams, including shared image exploitation and session hijacking.

**VLAN** -- Virtual Local Area Network. A logical network partition at the data link layer. VLAN segmentation is a common network defense that red teams may need to bypass for lateral movement.

---

## W

**WDAC** -- Windows Defender Application Control. A Windows security feature that restricts which applications, drivers, and scripts are permitted to run. WDAC is considered more robust than AppLocker and is a significant obstacle for payload execution.

**WMI** -- Windows Management Instrumentation. A Windows administration infrastructure for managing data and operations. WMI can be used for remote code execution, lateral movement, persistence (via WMI event subscriptions), and enumeration.

**WPAD** -- Web Proxy Auto-Discovery Protocol. A protocol that allows clients to automatically discover proxy configuration. WPAD can be abused via LLMNR/NBNS poisoning to intercept HTTP traffic or capture credentials.

**WSH** -- Windows Script Host. A Windows administration tool that provides scripting capabilities through VBScript and JScript engines. WSH (wscript.exe/cscript.exe) is commonly used to execute malicious scripts and is monitored by security tools.

**WinRM** -- Windows Remote Management. Microsoft's implementation of the WS-Management protocol for remote management. WinRM enables PowerShell Remoting and is a common lateral movement vector, operating over HTTP (5985) or HTTPS (5986).

---

## X
