# Red Team Methodology & Leadership

This section covers the foundational frameworks, planning processes, and leadership principles that guide a professional red team engagement from inception to final report delivery. Before any technical attack phase begins, a solid methodology ensures that operations are scoped, authorized, and aligned with organizational objectives.

## Section Overview

Red team methodology is the backbone of every successful engagement. This section establishes the operational discipline required to execute realistic adversary simulations while maintaining legal and ethical boundaries. Key concepts include the engagement lifecycle (planning, execution, reporting), rules of engagement that protect both the operator and the client, and threat modeling approaches that ensure the simulated attack mirrors real-world adversary behavior. Purple team integration ensures that findings translate directly into improved defensive posture, while strong reporting practices turn raw technical output into actionable business intelligence. Team management and lab infrastructure round out the operational foundation that supports all downstream kill chain phases.
